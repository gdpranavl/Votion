Hereâ€™s how to call the speech-to-text API from the backend:
```javascript
const { SpeechClient } = require('@google-cloud/speech');

const client = new SpeechClient();

async function transcribeAudio(audioBuffer) {
  const request = {
    audio: { content: audioBuffer.toString('base64') },
    config: { encoding: 'LINEAR16', sampleRateHertz: 16000, languageCode: 'en-US' },
  };

  const [response] = await client.recognize(request);
  return response.results.map(result => result.alternatives[0].transcript).join('\n');
}
```

## Design Aspects

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Built with Flutter for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for REST API support.
- **Database**: MongoDB for storing user data and journaling entries.
- **APIs**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for transcription and Firebase for authentication.

### Data Flow
1. **Input**: User interacts via voice or UI components.
2. **Processing**: Voice data is transcribed by the backend and stored in MongoDB.
3. **Output**: Processed data is displayed as text entries, progress graphs, or visual cues.

### User Interface
- **Design Principles**: Minimalist and high-contrast UI for better accessibility.
- **Tools**: Designed in Figma, implemented with Flutter widgets.
- **Libraries**: Utilizes packages like `provider` for state management and `flutter_chart` for visual data representation.
